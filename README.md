<h2>Web Scraping with Nokogiri and httparty</h2>

The repository showcases the use of the Nokogiri and HTTParty gems to perform web scraping by making HTTP requests and parsing HTML and XML documents.
Specifically, it includes an example of scraping the Wikipedia page to extract the list of films released in 2020. This demonstrates a practical application of these tools in gathering structured data from web pages.
